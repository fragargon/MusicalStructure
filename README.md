# Project Specifications

## App Design

1. **The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app. A similarly structured app which focuses on audiobooks, podcasts, or other audio media is also acceptable.**
2. **The purpose of each activity is easy for a user to understand through the UI design and feature labeling.**
3. **The app contains 2 to 6 activities**

## Layout

1. **OThe app contains multiple activities, each labelled, which together make a cohesive music app.**
2. **Features in the app are clearly defined either by labelling or images. For example, a button to play music could use a universally recognized triangular "Play" symbol or could have the text label "Play".**
3. **Each activity contains button(s) which link it to other activities a user should be able to reach from that activity. For instance, a ‘Library’ activity might contain a button to move to the ‘Now Playing’ activity.**
4. **The code adheres to all of the following best practices:**

- Text sizes are defined in sp
- Lengths are defined in dp
- Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.
5. **Rotation**. The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated. Either by updating the layout, adding a scrollable feature or some other mechanism that adheres to Android development guidelines.
6. **Best practices**. The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
   * Text sizes are defined in sp.
   * Lengths are defined in dp.
   * Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

The goal was to create an music structure app. Each screen must provide the ability to naviguate through the different app's screen.
I made a 3 screen music player: player - library music - playlist and a dialog screen with several option
On the player, the user is able to horizontaly scroll each album's song. The library is given through a grid view and the playlist favorites presented with a list view. Album, icon and button leads to another activity or dialog screen. As this is a structure the media player class is not implemented.


Design and implement an app to track scores between two teams within a basketball game.
